# Unquote

Removes the quotes around the selected text.

By default, if the cursor is within quoted text even if no text is selected, the quotes will be removed. This function can also be disabled in the configuration.

## Default Keybind

- Win: `ctrl` + `shift` + `7`
- macOS: `cmd` + `shift` + `7`

## Extension Settings

### Unquote without selection

If there is no text selected but the cursor is in a quoted string, it attempts to remove the quotes.

The default for this setting is enabled.
